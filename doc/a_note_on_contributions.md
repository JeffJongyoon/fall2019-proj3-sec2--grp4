Summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for facial emotion recognition. For the baseline model we used a gbm model for which we learned the best hyperparameters. For the improved model, we tried XGBoost, and saw some improvement but for the final model we ended up using a NN that learned from the pairwise distances of fiducial points in each image. Explanations as to which improvements we were able to obtain are in the python notebook with the improved model.
